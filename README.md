# ProfileMaker
A simple tool for making fake profiles. Uses names from UINames.
## How it works
You can use the profilemaker, name, and uinames commands. You **must** pass a --gender or -G parameter which must be 'M' or 'F'. You can also pass a --ext or -E parameter to get more info, like a fake email, password, and phone number.
